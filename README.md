# Docker_installation
Contains a bash script to install docker and ssh keys for people following along to the tutorial. If you're still having trouble getting ssh keys. You can use mine. But I do not recomend it. You should learn how to create yours. To use my ssh key just copy the public ssh key and paste it in the prompt asking you to paste your ssh key
